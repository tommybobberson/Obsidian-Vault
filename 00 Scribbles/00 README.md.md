# 00 Scribbles


## Purpose

This folder serves as your **inbox** or **scratchpad** for capturing quick thoughts, raw ideas, temporary notes, or unprocessed snippets before they are refined.

## Contents

*   Temporary `.md` notes containing unprocessed ideas.

## Workflow

1.  **Capture Quickly:** Create a new note here whenever an idea strikes or you need to save something temporarily. Use the [T - Scribble.md template](T%20-%20Scribble.md.md) for quick timestamping and tagging.
2.  **Process Regularly:** Make it a habit to review the notes in this folder (e.g., daily or weekly).
3.  **Refine or Discard:**
    *   If a note contains a distinct concept, refine it and move it to [10 Atomic Notes](z10%20README.md.md) using the [T - Atomic Note.md template](../90%20Meta/Templates/T%20-%20Atomic%20Note.md).
    *   If it adds information to an existing note, merge the content and delete the fleeting note.
    *   If it's no longer relevant or useful, delete it.
4.  **Goal:** Aim to keep this folder relatively empty. It's a processing queue, not long-term storage.

## Using the Template (`T - Scribble.md`)

This template is minimal by design for quick capture.

*   **YAML Frontmatter:**
    *   `tags: [scribble, inbox]`: These tags automatically mark the note as temporary and part of your inbox. Useful for searching (`tag:#scribble`) to find all notes needing processing. **Don't add other content tags here.**
    *    `status` : Indicate whether the note is WIP or has been Reviewed
    *   `created: {{date:YYYY-MM-DD HH:mm}}`: Automatically records when the note was created (requires Templates/Templater plugin).
*   **`# Scribble - {{date:YYYY-MM-DD}}`**: The main heading, auto-dated. You can rename the note file later if needed.
*   **`## Idea/Note`**: The main section. Just dump your thoughts, links, copy-pasted text, etc., here without worrying too much about structure yet.

**Things to Look Out For:**

*   **Resist Over-Structuring:** The point here is speed. Don't spend time formatting or adding many links *within* fleeting notes.
*   **Process Promptly:** These notes lose context quickly. Process them regularly to avoid building up a backlog of cryptic snippets.

## Template

*   Use the [T - Scribble.md template](T%20-%20Scribble.md.md).

## Key Connections

*   Input for potential [10 Atomic Notes](z10%20README.md.md).
*   Source of updates for existing notes throughout the vault.
