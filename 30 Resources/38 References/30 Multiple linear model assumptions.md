# Multiple Linear Model Assumptions 
## Summary / Abstract
Covers the assumptions in fitting a multiple linear model, and the assumptions you should verify
- no [[10 collinearity]] except in the case of confounding
- there is a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variable
- The residual values are:
	- normally distribued (plot histogram of residuals)
	- Homoscedastic (have a constant variance for all values of the variable)
	- Independent
- There is the need to account for, [[10 effect modification]]
