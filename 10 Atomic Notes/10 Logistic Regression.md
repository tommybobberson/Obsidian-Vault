# Logistic Regression 

## Assumptions
1. The dependent (outcome) variable is binary

2. Observations are independent: 
	- ensure no clustering or repeated measurements (e.g. same age group or location) that result in data being dependent 
	- If clustering exists, you can consider [[mixed effects models]] or [[Generalised  estimating equations]] to account for clustering

3. Adequate sample size
	- 
4. No perfect (Full) or little multi collinearity between independent variables
	- Test by calculating the **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)** -- assesses how much variance of a regression coefficient is inflated due to linear dependence among predictors
		- To test if variables are collinear, 
	- Remove variables that are collinear when:
		1. Its removal does not significantly impact the modelâ€™s interpretability or predictive power.
		2. The variable is not critical to the research question
		3. Other methods to address multicollinearity aren't practical or fail
	
5. Linear relationship between the [[10 logit]] of the response variable and explanatory variables (**not between the explanatory variables themselves unlike in [[10 Linear Regression|linear regression]])
	- For a system where $y = \beta X$, linearity here means that the predictor variable (not just $X$, can also be $X^2$ or $e^X$ etc, that's up to you to define), once defined, is linearly related to the log odds given by $y$.
	  - Can be tested with the [[Box-Tidwell test]]
	
6. Absence of highly influential outliers
	- Can be tested by calculating **Cook's distance** for each observation
	- in the presence of such:
	  1. remove them
	  2. replace them with another value like a mean or median
	  3. keep them and make a note about it when reporting

#### Linked Concepts (Auto-Generated)
```dataviewjs
// Requires Dataview plugin. Lists outgoing links from this note's body
// that likely point to other Atomic Notes (by checking the path).
const outlinks = dv.current().file.outlinks;
// Filter for links pointing to the '10 Atomic Notes' folder (adjust path if needed)
const conceptLinks = outlinks.filter(link => link.path.startsWith("10 Atomic Notes/"));
if (conceptLinks.length > 0) {
    dv.list(conceptLinks);
} else {
    dv.paragraph("No links to other Atomic Notes detected in the body.");
}
