# descriptive statistical modelling

$independent variable + dependent variable$ -> $descriptive model$ -> $association is summarised$  
- Aimed at summarising **measured** data in a concise way
- More of telling a story instead of confirming a causal hypothesis, less formally deals with [[Association and Causation|causation]] if at all
- Depends on how statistical tools are used, 
	-e.g. regression models which are used for both [[10 predictive statistical modelling]] and [[10 Explanatory statistical modelling]] can be employed too but with the goal of capturing the [[10 association]] (not causation) bettween the dependent and independent variable
