# Overview:
In this document we we will be going through the different facets of doing EDA in R

# R for EDA
### packages (and functions)
- `analyzer` 
     -  `plottr` - visualises the distributions of variables in a data frame or their distribution against a common dependent variable, by the class of the dependent and independent variables 
- [[10 ggplot2]]
### Practices
### Saving graphs
- Save them as vectors (preferred as they can be resized easily): `.pdf` or `.svg`
- Save them as rasters (smaller): `jpg or png`

#### Linked Concepts (Auto-Generated)
```dataviewjs
// Requires Dataview plugin. Lists outgoing links from this note's body
// that likely point to other Atomic Notes (by checking the path).
const outlinks = dv.current().file.outlinks;
// Filter for links pointing to the '10 Atomic Notes' folder (adjust path if needed)
const conceptLinks = outlinks.filter(link => link.path.startsWith("10 Atomic Notes/"));
if (conceptLinks.length > 0) {
    dv.list(conceptLinks);
} else {
    dv.paragraph("No links to other Atomic Notes detected in the body.");
}
```
